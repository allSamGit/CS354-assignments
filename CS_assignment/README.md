#Language  Comparison(C# and java):

- They are both object oriented languages.
- Very close similarity in terms of syntax and notations.
- classes and objects are defined in same way in both languages.
- Inheritance uses the symbol ":" instead of "extend" term in java
- C# components are called controls which will be added to form
- C# uses namespace for each classes in the project directory but java doesn't.
